## Introduction

If you want to git clone this project and run a premade Grapla-Vue test project, check README in the /src folder

The following is for using Grapla-Vue as a github dependency in your own project

## Install

In your package.json file

```bash
"dependencies": {
  "grapla-vue": "https://github.com/FindOut/grapla-vue.git"
}
```

Then run the command:

```bash
npm install grapla-vue
```

## Import

ES6 with vue-loader:

```bash
<script>
import grapla from 'grapla-vue'

export default {
  components: {
    ...grapla.components
  },
  methods: {
    ...grapla.functions
  }
}
</script>
```

ES5:

```bash
var grapla = require("grapla-vue");
```

## Usage

Supports data-driven creation of elements as well as slots

Example JSON:

```bash
data: {
  nodes: [
    {
      id: 0, # all nodes need unique ids if relationships use ids
      text: 'element text', # optional text in elements
      type: 'Box', # type is necessary when using the dynamicComponent
      x: 400, # when using the coordinatesLayout
      y: 100, # when using the coordinatesLayout
      width: 200, # when using the coordinatesLayout
      height: 100, # when using the coordinatesLayout
      children: [ # for nested elements
        {
          id: 1,
          type: 'Ball',
        },
        {
          id: 2,
          type: 'Ball',
        },
      ]
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      type: 'Ball',
      x: 200,
      y: 300,
      width: 100,
      height: 100,
    }
  ],
  relationships: [
    {
      from: 1, # will draw a line between two elements based on id
      to: 2, # will draw a line between two elements based on id
    },
    {
      from: 0,
      to: 3,
    },
    {
      path: 'M200 420,C80 420,80 130,250 130' # will draw a finished path based on string
    }
  ]
}
```

Example HTML:

```bash
# main grapla component
<grapla>

  # flexWrapLayout component for positioning child elements according to flex-wrap flow
  <flex-wrap-layout slot="layout">
    # v-for looping out nodes as boxes based on data array
    <box
      v-for="node in data.nodes"
      :data="node"
      :key="node.id">
      # v-for looping out child nodes as balls based on children array
      <ball
        v-for="childNode in node.children"
        :data="childNode"
        :key="childNode.id">  
      </ball>
    </box>
  </flex-wrap-layout>

  # v-for looping out relationships based on data array
  <relationship
    v-for="(relationship, index) in data.relationships"
    :data="relationship"
    :key="index"
    slot="rels">
  </relationship>

</grapla>
```

Or:

```bash
# main grapla component
<grapla>

  # flexWrapLayout component for positioning child elements according to flex-wrap flow
  <flex-wrap-layout slot="layout">
    # v-for looping out nodes based on data array
    # dynamicComponent will create element based on type variable, like 'Box' or 'Ball'
    <dynamic-component
      v-for="node in data.nodes"
      :data="node"
      :key="node.id">
      # if the node is a box, it will generate child components based on it's children array
      # the ball component cannot have child components
    </dynamic-component>
  </flex-wrap-layout>

  # v-for looping out relationships based on data array
  <relationship
    v-for="(relationship, index) in data.relationships"
    :data="relationship"
    :key="index"
    slot="rels">
  </relationship>

</grapla>
```

Or:

```bash
# main grapla component
<grapla>

  # coordinatesLayout component for absolute positioning child elements
  # set x y width and height on child elements
  <coordinates-layout :data="{width: 900, height: 600}" slot="layout">
    <box :data="{id: 99, text: 'test', x: 300, y: 400, width: 200, height: 100}"></box>
    <ball :data="{id: 100, x: 700, y: 300, width: 150, height: 150}"></ball>
    <box :data="{id: 101, text: 'test test', x: 300, y: 150, width: 100, height: 200}">
      # ball component inside box component
      <ball :data="{id: 102}"></ball>
    </box>
  </coordinates-layout>

  # relationship components that draw a line between two elements based on ids
  <relationship :data="{ from: 99, to: 100 }" slot="rels"></relationship>
  <relationship :data="{ from: 100, to: 102 }" slot="rels"></relationship>
  # relationship component can also take a finished svg path d string
  <relationship :data="{ path: 'M200 400,C100 400,100 150,250 150' }" slot="rels"></relationship>

</grapla>
```

Make sure to set 'slot' attribute on layout and relationship components for grapla to know how to use the component

```bash
# main grapla component
<grapla>
  # layout components use slot 'layout'
  <flex-wrap-layout slot="layout">
    <box :data="{id: 0, text: 'a box'}">
      <ball :data="{id: 1}"></ball>
    </box>
    <box :data="{id: 2, text: 'another box'}"></box>
  </flex-wrap-layout>
  # relationship components use slot 'rels'
  <relationship :data="{ from: 0, to: 2 }" slot="rels"></relationship>
</grapla>
```

## Using Custom Components

You can use your own custom components as nodes instead of Grapla's own Box and Ball components. If you do that, here are some requirements for it to work: 

- If you're using relationship components with 'from' and 'to' properties, your custom component needs to have these values applied to them as a CSS class. For example, if you have a relationship with 'from' value 'AMP-7' and 'to' value 'AMP-11', two of the custom components you're using as nodes need to have the CSS classes 'AMP-7' and 'AMP-11' respectively, or else the relationship component won't know which elements to draw the relationship between. 

Example:

```bash
# main grapla component
<grapla>
  <custom-component :data="{id: 0}"></custom-component>
  <custom-component :data="{id: 1}"></custom-component>
  <relationship :data="{ from: 0, to: 1 }" slot="rels"></relationship>
</grapla>

#custom component
<template>
  <div :class="data.id">
    // my custom component
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: {
    data: Object
  }
}
</script>
```
